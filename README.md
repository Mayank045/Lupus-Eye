# Lupus-Eye
Developed “Lupus Eye”, a prototype AI-powered surveillance website aimed at enhancing ATM security.  Used a computer vision model to detect robbery threats and identify tools/weapons from live CCTV footage.  Learned to build websites efficiently using AI tools like Cursor AI and Loveable, streamlining development and design.
